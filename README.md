# request-interceptor  
This project is simple.  
1. Consuming available API  
2. Using feign client with some configuration to make it able to inject the signature before really calling to the API
  
Because this is just example so you will not see how the error will be thrown if your request is invalid.  
But using the same mechanism can help you a lot if you have the similar problem.  

After cloning this project, you can run the Application class and access localhost:8080/info when application started.  
You can also do the debug to see how things work together.  
Happy Coding!
